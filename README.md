## Electric Vehicle

<pre>Why EV?
1.Pollution:
According to DOE (USA)
• Transportation accounts for one third of all energy
usage.
• Use of 10% of ZEV cuts 1 million tons/year of air
pollutants
•With 100% EV - CO2 emission would be cut by half
2.Capital Cost and Maintenance Cost:
• EV has a more capital cost
• But life cycle cost of EV is lesser than ICEV
3.Availability of Fuel
Fast depletion of fossil fuel and
dependence on middle east countries for
fuel.
4.Well to Wheel Efficiency
The EV is found to have a better WTW
efficiency than ICEV

What is an EV?
It is a vehicle which has following
features
• Portable energy source
• Traction effort provided by electric
motor

Components of an EV
• Battery
It powers the electric motor. Its capacity is defined
in Ah.
The design of battery includes complex calculations
which determines various battery parameters
• Power convertor
The electrical energy stored in battery is fixed DC
which should be converted to either variable DC or
Variable AC which depends on the type of electric motor
used for power the wheels
• Electric Motor
DC series, Induction motors were used at the
earlier stage. Now the scope has shifted towards
special electrical machines

Components of an EV Contd.,
• Clutch
The engine must be decoupled from the wheels to
shift from low speed to high speed gears or vice versa,
this is done by the clutch.
• Transmission
The gearbox is also called as transmission which
allows transfer of power from engine to wheels.
• Drivetrain
The combination of Electric motor, Clutch, Gearbox
is referred to as drivetrain
• Controller
It is an electronic device that controls the amount
of power delivered to electric motor according to the signal
from the potentiometer connected to throttle pedal.</pre>
